    <h1>RegEx Practice</h1>

    <script>
      // First technique we can use is the ".test()" method.
      // It takes a RegEx and it applies it to a string (inside the parenthesis)

      let frase = "mascarpone bollente";
      let regEx1 = /masca/;
      let result1 = regEx1.test(frase);
      console.log("Result 1 is: " + result1); // This expression will return TRUE since /masca/ can be found in the string "mascarpone bollente".
      // Remember!!! The match must be perfect, character by character if it was /MaScA/ the expression would return false.

      // This is great but we can only use it to match one single pattern.
      // Enter the OR | operator. Using it we can match for multiple patterns.
      // The regEx could be /dog|cat|fish|bird/ and the test method would be able to find out if one of the regExs can be found in the string.

      // OK, the .test() method returns either true or false if the regex is found or not.
      // WE can also use the .match() method that insted returns an Array with the matches found in the expression.
      // Let's test it out.
      // REMEMBER, the order is the opposite. The string we are "analizing" now goes first, and our RegEx goes inside the paranthesis.

      let frase2 = "The rain in SPAIN stays mainly in the plain";
      let regEx2 = /ain/i;
      let result2 = frase2.match(regEx2);
      console.log(result2);

      let frase3 = "Barraccuni23";
      let regEx3 = /[^A-Za-z0-9]+/ig;
      let result3 = regEx3.test(frase3);
      console.log(result3);
