    <h1>Array Map</h1>
    <script>
      // So, array.map() works very similarly to array.filter. There are a few differences though.
      // Sometimes array.map() is used to create a new array with UPDATED values (withough touching the original array).

      // Example 1
      // Let's say we want a new array with these values discounted by 50%.

      const prices = [20, 10, 50, 25, 35, 46, 80];

      // We initialize the new array and we call the map() function
      const halfPrice = prices.map((item) => item / 2);
      // the values of halfPrice will be [10, 5, 25, 12.5, 17.5, 23, 40];

      // Example 2
      // Let's say we have an object with multiple keys and we just want to create an array with the values of one single key. How do we do it Watson?

      const products = [
        {name: "shoes", price: 11},
        {name: "mouse", price: 15},
        {name: "keyboard", price: 50},
        {name: "CPU", price: 40},
        {name: "monitor", price: 22},
      ];

      let namesOnly = products.map((item) => item.name);
      console.log(namesOnly)
      // the value of namesOnly will be ['shoes', 'mouse', 'keyboard', 'CPU', 'monitor'];

      // Example 3
      // Using the same array above (products). Let's say we want to discount the price to 50% of only the items whose price is above 30.

      let discountedProducts = products.map((product) => {
        if (product.price > 30) {
          return {name: product.name, price: product.price / 2}; // We are returning a "new" object because that is what we want to have in the new array
        } else {
          return product; // If we omit this line, the objects whose price is less than 30 will return as undefined inside the new array.
        }
      });

      // Example 4

      // Let's say we want to create a new array with the full name of the people in the persons array.

      const persons = [
        {firstname: "Malcom", lastname: "Reynolds"},
        {firstname: "Kaylee", lastname: "Frye"},
        {firstname: "Jayne", lastname: "Cobb"},
      ];

      // The function iterates through the array, gets the first name and last name and it "joins" them with an empty space.
      let fullNames = persons.map((person) => [person.firstname, person.lastname].join(" "));
      console.log(fullNames)
