      // We can use the method "instanceof" to test if a certain object has been created with a certain constructor. In this case, the expression will return true.
      console.log(jackie instanceof Birdie);

      // We can check if an object has a certain property using the hasOwnProperty method and looking for a property by its name.
      console.log(jackie.hasOwnProperty("nick"));

      // Let's create an empty array and fill it with the object's properties.
      let objProps = [];

      }

      console.log("objProps array is: " + objProps);
      // THIS IS WHAT WE'LL SEE IN THE CONSOLE: objProps array is: name,color,nick;

      // IF WE HAVE A PROPERTY THAT IS CONSISTENT IN EVERY ISTANCE OF THE OBJECT WE CAN ADD IT TO THE OBJECT'S PROTOTYPE.
      // THIS WAY WE AVOID HAVING A COPY OF THE SAME PROPERTY FOR EACH ISTANCE OF AN OBJECT.

      function Bear(name, color) {
        this.name = name;
        this.color = color;
        //this.numLegs = 4; // SINCE numLegs IS GOING TO BE CONSISTENT IN EVERY ISTANCE OF THE BEAR OBJECT WE WILL ADD IT TO ITS PROTOTYPE.

      Bear.prototype.numLegs = 4;

      let yogi = new Bear("Yogi", "Teal");
      console.log(yogi.numLegs); // THIS WILL OUTPUT 4.

      // We have now seen two kinds of properties: own properties and prototype properties. Own properties are defined directly on the object instance itself. And prototype properties are defined on the prototype.

      // HERE'S ANOTHER WAY TO CHECK IF AN OBJECT HAS BEEN CREATED USING A CERTAIN CONSTRUCTOR.

      function isBearFamily(candidate) {
        if (candidate.constructor === Bear) {
          return "Yep, it's a bear";

        }
      }

      console.log(isBearFamily(yogi)); // THIS EXPRESSION WILL RETURN "Yep, it's a bear", BECAUSE YOGI WAS INDEED CREATED USING THE BEAR CONSTRUCTOR.

      // WE CAN ALSO ADD METHODS TO A CONSTRUCTOR PROTOTYPE. NOW ALL ISTANCES OF BEAR WILL HAVE THE eat() METHOD.
      // DOING SO BECOMES VERY SLOW AND TEDIOUS QUICKLY. WE CAN DO THIS THE QUICK WAY, CREATING AND OBJECT WITH ALL THE PROPERTIES WE WANNA ADD TO THE PROTOTYPE.

      Bear.prototype.eat = function () {
        console.log("GNAM GNAM GNAM");
      };

      // Bear.prototype = {
      //   tails: 1,
      //   paws: 4,
      //   describe() {
      //     console.log("I AM A BEAR AND MY NAME IS " + this.name);
      //   },
      // };

      let bubu = new Bear("Bubu", "Purple");
      console.log(bubu.describe());

      // There is one crucial side effect of manually setting the prototype to a new object. It erases the constructor property!
      // To fix this, whenever a prototype is manually set to a new object, remember to define the constructor property:

      Bear.prototype = {
        constructor: Bear, // <--- LIKE SO!
        tails: 1,
        paws: 4,
        describe() {
          console.log("I AM A BEAR AND MY NAME IS " + this.name);
        },
