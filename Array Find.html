    <h1>Array Find</h1>

    <script>
      // REMEMBER
      // If the array we are iterating through is an array of objects array.find() will return the whole object (not the single property)


      // Example 1

      // Let's say we want to find the FIRST score that is higher than a certain amount inside the array scores[]
      // What find() does is execute the statement inside the callback function and it stops as soon as an item passes the test and returns true.
      // In this example we are trying to find if there is a score inside the array that is higher than 46.
      // So the find() method goes through the array and tests the items but it stops as soon as one items satisfies the condition inside the callback function.
      // 1. [21] doesn't pass the test
      // 2. [46] doesn't either and the same for [32]
      // 3. [50] is greater than [46] so it passes the test and returns the value 50
      // 4. find() will not get to [70] since we have already found an element that passes the test so it stops iterating.

      const scores = [21, 46, 32, 50, 24, 8, 11, 70];

      let firstHighScore = scores.find((score) => score > 46);

      // Example 2

      // In this example we have an array of objects, so if find() returns true it will return the entire object that satisfies the condition of the callback function.

      const products = [
        { name: "mouse", price: 15 },
        { name: "keyboard", price: 50 },
        { name: "CPU", price: 40 },
        { name: "shoes", price: 11 },
        { name: "monitor", price: 22 },
        { name: "mouse pad", price: 5 },
        { name: "keyboard", price: 250 },
      ];

      // Let's say we want to check if there is an elemente whose .name is "keyboard". If there is we will get in return the whole object.
      // As we can see there are 2 items with the name "keyboard", but the find() method stops at the first one since it passes the test.

      let findKeyboard = products.find((item) => item.price === "keyboard");

      // This time we are trying to find an object whose price is less than 15.
      // The find() method will return the object "shoes" since it is the first element that passes the conditional test.
      // We will not get to see "mouse pad" since the methos has already stopped at the first item.

      let findCheapItem = products.find((item) => item.price < 15);
